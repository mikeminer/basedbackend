# 💙 BasedButton • Withdraw Interface https://mikeminer.github.io/basedbackend/

A minimal, **wallet-native front-end** for interacting with the  
[`BasedButton`](https://basescan.org/address/0x37e3a8d3ba53f43d955f83b54cbe4c0d39a10b83) smart contract on **Base Mainnet**.

> 🛠️ Built for BUIDLers who value simplicity, blue aesthetics, and real onchain UX.

---

## 🔹 What it does
This ultra-lightweight front-end allows the **contract owner** to:
- Connect with **MetaMask** or **Rabby Wallet**  
- Check the current **contract balance** (`tipsBalance`)  
- Specify a **destination wallet** and **amount in ETH**  
- Execute the `withdraw()` transaction directly on **Base Mainnet**

All wrapped in a **single HTML file** — no frameworks, no servers, no installs.
